This repo contains the code used in my Master's thesis, "Systematic Design of Blockchain-Based Continuous Authentication Towards Vulnerable Road User (VRU) Safety"

The repo is broken into two main directories: **Ch3_Thesis** and **Ch4_Thesis**

# Ch3_Thesis Directory
The Ch3_Thesis directory contains the code relevant to Chapter 3, which focused on the prototyping of a CAV emergency messaging application and an analysis of queuing delay for a single RSU. The CAV_EmergencyMessageApp and RouterQueueDelay sub-directories each contain seperate README files detailing how to run the code. 

# Ch4_Thesis Directory
The Ch4_Thesis directory contains code relevant to Chapter 4, which focused on the development of an Ethereum-based smart contract for continuous authentication of RSU devices. The Ch4_Thesis_README file details how to run the code. The execution of the code as-written relies on the use of Truffle Suite Ganache for Ethereum blockchain emulation. As of Spring 2025 the Truffle Suite has been deprecated, with development support having shifted to different priorities as part of the Consensys/Hardhat partnership. However, the Truffle Suite (specifically the Truffle and Ganache utilities) remain available in a public archive (archive.trufflesuite.com/ganache).
